# About Me

 >So, I am Siva Bala Kumaran S, y'all can call me Siva. I might be pursuing mechanical engineering but I've always had a passion for the software side of things. Especially, **AI/ML** and also I'm more into **Robotics**.
 
 As for what I wanna become, I am not sure yet tbh. On a general term, I'd say like any normal student would say, -  **A Millionare**. The reason for my uncertainty is because, I dont know which field, I should get onto. Like, I want to utilize both my mechanical skills and my software passion into one and get into *Robotics* domain. But I also have a side, that wants to work at **FAANG**. I'll figure it out eventually though.So, that's the technical stuff about me and my interests. 
 ## Beyond technical/acads stuff
 
 So, lemme get onto what I do when I'm taking a break. So, one of the things that I do is I read *books*. Both *fictional* and *non-fictional*. Some of my favs in fiction are, 
 - *DaVinci Code(by Dan Brown)*, 
 - *Run(by Blake Crouch)*, 
 - *13 reasons why(by Jay Asher)*,
 - *Time Machine(by H G Wells)*. 
 
And my fav non fiction books include, -
- *Attitude is Everything(by Jeff Keller)*, 
 - *Art of war(by Sun Tzu)*,
 - *Subtle art of not giving a f#ck(by Mark Manson)* 
And a lot more but I re read these frequently. 
 
 If I'm not reading a book, I'd be listening to music. Some of my fav artists include, 
- *Eminem*,
- *The Weeknd*,
- *Travis Scott*,
- *Shawn Mendes*,
- *Juice World*,
- *K Dot*,
- *The Beatles*,
- *Queen* 
and a lot more. These were the ones stuck at the top of my head.

If I'm not doing either, then I'd be playing games in my laptop. My fav games would be, 
- *Elden Ring*,
- *The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild*, 
- *Sekiro: Shadows die twice*,
- *Hollow Knight*, 
- *all the soulsborne games*,
- *Marvel Rivals/Overwatch 2*. 
I'm not quite into Valo. I have a whole list of games but if someone asks me what are my fav games, I'd mention these. 

I care a lot about my fitness. So every morning/evening, I'd go on a **jog** and **hit the gym thrice a week**. I love playing badminton, so when I'm not goin to the gym, *I'd play badminton*.

As for my fav movies, 
- *Fight Club*, 
- *Pulp Fiction*, 
- *Interstellar*,
- *The Hangover*

- *Space odyssey*. 
 
I also watch a lot of anime, some of my favs are,

- *Jojos Bizarre Adventures*, 
- *Bleach*,
- *Cyberpunk : Edgerunners*,
- *Haikyuu*,
- *Horimiya*,

## Final Thoughts
If you ask me, **Who do you look up to ?**, I'd say, 
>**My Future Self**. 

I know that sounds hella cringey but that is the truth. All in all, it could be said that, **I am a nerd**. And I would agree cuz that is who I am. And that's about it.
